Solved puzzles and data structure implementations in C/C++

The code provided in this repository is the result of little puzzles or small exercises done to review C/C++ or some data structures.

A Summary of the content would be:

Data Structures:
* Stack implementation implemented with an array
* Stack implementation implemented with pointers
* Double linked list implemented with pointers

Puzzles and programming interview challenges:
* Binary search over a sorted array
* Eight queens problem
* Factorial calculation, the recursive way
* Finding 2 or 3 numbers from an array that add up to certain amount
* Small example of function pointers in C
* Probability function problem (this is specially interesting IMO)
* String functions: reverse string, remove chars, reverse words in phrase, find repeated patterns (brute force approach), convert string into integer.
* Sorting the chars in a string using a histogram approach

I have more things to commit here, but I haven't had time to commit yet.
